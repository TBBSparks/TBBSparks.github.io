#My Background and Coding Breakthrough
>Born and raised in the Kansas City metro area, I feel I had an average surburban childhood.  As I exceled in school, I thought I would persue the profession of a trauma surgeon.  I worked with MAST (Metropolitian Ambulance Service & Trust) in conjunction with college courses my final year in high school through the explorer program.  This further fuled my interest in the medical field.  However, life had other plans for me, and I quickly adapted to the challenges it threw at me. >> Fast forward about 10 years.  I was not the trauma surgeon I thought I would be.  Instead, I was a professional parent.  I was specifically trained to help care for behavioral and medically classified children.  It was impossible to keep a job, let alone go to school.

>In 2017, my life again make a sudden left turn.  I was finding permanancy for the children in my care, going through a divorce, and needing a job.  But after all that time, the desire to spend 12 years in college no longer appealed to me.  I started with a company willing to bring me in after such a "gap" in traditional employment.  I wanted to go back for my BBA, but I wanted more flexibility and value to potential employers, thus giving me an edge over my competition.  Then a pandemic hit, and what better time to take an online course than when you literally have nothing better to do?  At first I struggled (more than that NYC rat taking a slice of pizza home to his family!) with wrapping my mind around code.  For weeks I thought I had made a terrible investment.  I could google and read how to do something, and reproduce it with average results.  Although I was getting A's on my assignments, my heart was not enjoying code.  I did not care I could make a clickable button.  What good was that to me?  I (still) cannot tell you which library is my favorite or the best.  I had lost passion for this potentially wonderful opportunity.  One evening, while completing my assignment, I came across a repository that had a link in it.  I was taken to a webpage!  What sorcery was this?  Turns out, that was our very next assignment.  The visual stimulation and results in color was all it took to get me enthusiastic about the course again.  MatPlotlib?  I'm your girl.  Plot.ly is my BFF.  Web page design and manipulation?  








I found my passion for coding.  I play around with assigments for fun now (who makes their earthquake data shake to simulate an earthquake just to see if they can?  Totally me!)  It is such a fun way to put my type 1 personality to purpose.  It's a complex task that yields extraordinary visual results.  On a scale of Bran to Arya Stark, I was finally able to participate at a level of Jon Snow to Arya again.

Flexible Data Analyst with background in office management; profieient in documenting, intrepreting and analyzing data in a dynamic enviornment.  Commands deep familiarity in all parts of Excel.  Highly skilled in preparing in-depth documents and reports while simultaneously managing other data analysis responsibilities.  

ng workflows with the various platforms, trained many associates within the organization. These experiences helped me to advance my skills in problem-solving, troubleshooting, communication, collaboration and time management. I am passionate about data analytics because I have the opportunity to create stories using data and graphs to understand relationships between many variables. I earned my certificate in Data Analytics from a bootcamp at the University of Kansas, with skills in VBA scripting, Pandas, Python, and SQL. This proficiency combined with my experience with problem solving and presenting solutions allows me to contribute to any team.
